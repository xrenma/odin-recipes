                <p>You can find most of the ingredients in a Japanese market. </p>
                <p>You can substitute dried Welsh onions for green onions. You can substitute dried basil and sage for fresh if preferred. </p>
                <p>Start preparing pork while waiting for the water to boil for the egg so everything is finished by the time the egg is cooked and cooled. </p>
